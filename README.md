# openEO Test Suite

Test suite for validation of openEO back-ends against the openEO API and related specifications.

## Install/Setup

Clone this repository and some git submodules with additional assets/data, e.g.:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-test-suite.git
```

As always in Python usage and development,
it is recommended to work in some sort of virtual environment (`venv`, `virtualenv`, `conda`, `docker`, ...)
to run and develop this project.
Depending on your use case and workflow, you can choose to reuse an existing environment or create a new one.

### Example virtual environment setup

Python's standard library includes a [`venv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
to create virtual environments.
A common practice is to create a virtual environment in a subdirectory `venv` of your project,
which can be achieved by running this from the project root:

```bash
python -m venv --prompt . venv
```

Note: the `--prompt .` option is a trick to automatically
use the project root directory name in your shell prompt
when the virtual environment is activated.
It's optional, but it generally makes your life easier
when you have multiple virtual environments on your system.

### Virtual environment activation

The following instructions will assume that the virtual environment of your choosing is activated.
For example, when using the `venv` approach from above,
activate the virtual environment in your shell with:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

Install the project and its dependencies in your virtual environment with:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Note: the `-e` option installs the project in "editable" mode,
which makes sure that code changes will be reflected immediately in your virtual environment
without the need of (re)installing the project.


#### Additional dependencies related to runners for individual process testing

The individual process testing module of the test suite allows to pick
a specific process "runner" (see further for more documentation).
Some of these runners require additional optional dependencies to be installed in your virtual environment,
which can be done by providing an appropriate "extra" identifier in the `pip install` command:

- For the "dask" runner:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dask]
    ```
- For the "vito" runner:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[vito] --extra-index-url https://artifactory.vgt.vito.be/api/pypi/python-openeo/simple
    ```

Note that it might be not possible to install both "dask" and "vito" extras
in the same environment because of conflicting dependency constraints.


## Running the test suite

The test suite at least requires an openEO backend URL to run against.
It can be specified through a `pytest` command line option

    pytest --openeo-backend-url=openeo.example

    # Or using the short form `-U` (at the cost of being less descriptive):
    pytest -U openeo.example

If no explicit protocol is specified, `https://` will be assumed automatically.


## Additional run options

In addition to the `--openeo-backend-url` option, there are several other options
to control some aspects of the test suite run.

### Process selection

Various tests depend on the availability of certain openEO processes.
It is possible to only run tests for a subset of processes with these
process selection options:

- `--processes` to define a comma-separated list of processes to test against.
  - Example: `--processes=min,load_stac_,apply,reduce_dimension`.
- `--process-levels` to select whole groups of processes based on
  predefined [process profiles](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/developers/profiles/processes.html),
  specified as a comma-separated list of levels.
  - Example: `--process-levels=L1,L2`.`
  - A level does not imply other levels, so each desired level must be specified explicitly.
    For example, L2 does **not** include L1 automatically.

If neither `--processes` nor `--process-levels` are specified, all processes are considered.
If both are specified, the union of both will be considered.

- `--experimental`: By default, experimental processes (or experimental process tests) are ignored.
  Enabling this option will consider experimental processes and tests.


### Runner for individual process testing

One module of the test suite is dedicated to **individual process testing**,
where each process is tested individually with a given set of inputs and expected outputs.
Because there are a lot of these tests (order of thousands),
it is very time-consuming to run these through the standard, HTTP based openEO REST API.
As a countermeasure, the test suite ships with several experimental **runners**
that aim to execute the tests directly against a (locally running) back-end implementation
to eliminate HTTP-related and other overhead.
Note that this typically requires additional dependencies to be installed in your test environment.

The desired runner can be specified through the `--runner` option,
with currently one of the following options:

- `skip` (**default**): Skip all individual process tests.
  - This is the default to avoid accidentally running a very heavy/costly test suite.
- `http`: Run the individual processing tests through a standard openEO REST API.
  - Requires `--openeo-backend-url` to be set as described above.
  - As noted above, this will very likely result a very heavy test suite run by default.
    It is therefore recommended to limit the test suite scope
    in some way: e.g. limited process selection through `--processes`
    or running against a dedicated/localhost deployment.
  - Another limitation of this runner is that not all process tests
    can be executed as some input-output pairs are not JSON encodable.
    These tests will be marked as skipped.
- `dask`: Executes the tests directly via the [openEO Dask implementation](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes-dask) (as used by EODC, EURAC, and others)
  - Requires [openeo_processes_dask](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes-dask) package being installed in test environment.
    See installation instructions above for more practical info.
  - Covers all implemented processes.
- `vito`: Executes the tests directly via the
  [openEO Python Driver implementation](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-python-driver) (as used by CDSE, VITO/Terrascope, and others).
  - Requires [openeo_driver](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-python-driver) package being installed in test environment.
    See installation instructions above for more practical info.
  - Only covers a subset of processes due to the underlying architecture of the back-end implementation.
    In particular, it only covers the pure Python code paths, but not the PySpark related aspects.

See [openeo_test_suite/lib/process_runner](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-test-suite/tree/main/src/openeo_test_suite/lib/process_runner)
for more details about these runners and inspiration to implement your own runner.


#### Usage examples of individual process testing with runner option

The individual process tests can be run by specifying the `src/openeo_test_suite/tests/processes/processing` as test path.
Some use examples with different options discussed above:

```bash
# Basic default behavior: run all individual process tests,
# but with the default runner (skip), so no tests will actually be executed.
pytest src/openeo_test_suite/tests/processes

# Run tests for a subset of processes with the HTTP runner
# against the openEO Platform backend at openeo.cloud
pytest --runner=http --openeo-backend-url=openeo.cloud --processes=min,max src/openeo_test_suite/tests/processes/processing

# Run tests for a subset of processes with the VITO runner
pytest --runner=vito --process-levels=L1,L2,L2A src/openeo_test_suite/tests/processes/processing

# Run all individual process tests with the Dask runner
pytest --runner=dask src/openeo_test_suite/tests/processes
```





## Authentication of the basic `connection` fixture

The test suite provides a basic `connection` fixture
(an `openeo.Connection` object as defined in the `openeo` Python library package)
to interact with the backend.

There are several ways to set up authentication for this connection fixture,
building on the ["dynamic authentication method selection" feature of the `openeo` Python library package](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/auth.html#oidc-authentication-dynamic-method-selection),
which is driven by the `OPENEO_AUTH_METHOD` environment variable:

- `OPENEO_AUTH_METHOD=none`: no authentication will be done
- `OPENEO_AUTH_METHOD=basic`: basic authentication will be triggered.
  Username and password can be specified through additional environment variables
  `OPENEO_AUTH_BASIC_USERNAME`, and `OPENEO_AUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD`.
  Alternatively, it is also possible to handle basic auth credentials through
  the [auth configuration system and `openeo-auth` tool](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/auth.html#auth-config-files-and-openeo-auth-helper-tool)
  from the `openeo` Python library package.
- `OPENEO_AUTH_METHOD=client_credentials`: OIDC with "client credentials" grant,
  which [assumes some additional environment variables to set the client credentials](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/auth.html#oidc-client-credentials-using-environment-variables).
- If nothing is specified (the default), the default behavior of `connection.authenticate_oidc()` is followed:
  - Valid OIDC refresh tokens will be used if available
  - Otherwise, the OIDC device code flow is initiated.
    Make sure to check the logging/output of the test suite run
    for instructions on how to complete the authentication flow.


## Reporting

Being a `pytest` based test suite, various plugins can be used to generate reports in different formats as desired.

### HTML report

Producing reports in HTML format is enabled by default (using the `pytest-html` plugin).
Basic usage example
(note that this usually has to be combined with other `pytests` options commented elsewhere in this document):

    pytest --html=reports/report.html

### JUnitXML report

JUnitXML reports are useful for integration with CI systems like Jenkins.
Support for it is built-in in `pytest` through the `--junit-xml` option:

    pytest --junit-xml=reports/report.xml



## Development and contributions

The test suite builds on [`pytest`](https://pytest.org/),
a featureful testing library for Python that makes it easy to write succinct, readable tests
and can scale to support complex functional testing.
It has some particular features (fixtures, leveraging the `assert` statement, test parameterization, ...)
that are worth getting familiar with.

### Pre-commit hooks

This project provides (git) pre-commit hooks to tidy up simple code quality problems and catch syntax issues before committing.
While not enforced, it is encouraged and appreciated to enable this in your working copy before contributing code.

#### Pre-commit Setup

- Install the general [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool.
  The simplest option is to install it directly in the virtual environment you are using for this project (e.g. `pip install pre-commit`)
  You can also install it globally
  (e.g. using a package manager like [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), conda, homebrew, ...)
  so you can use this tool across different projects.
- Install the project specific git hook scripts and utilities
  (defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file)
  by running this in the root of your working copy:

      pre-commit install

#### Pre-commit Usage

When you commit new changes, the pre-commit hook will automatically run each of the configured linters/formatters/...
Some of these just flag issues (e.g. invalid JSON files) while others even automatically fix problems (e.g. clean up excessive whitespace).
If there is some kind of violation, the commit will be blocked. Address these problems and try to commit again.

Some pre-commit tools directly edit your files (e.g. fix code style) instead of just flagging issues.
This might feel intrusive at first, but once you get the hang of it, it should allow to streamline your development workflow.
In particular, it is recommended to use git's staging feature to prepare your commit.
Pre-commit’s proposed changes are not staged automatically, so you can more easily keep them separate for review.

> **Note**
> You can temporarily disable pre-commit for these rare cases where you intentionally want to commit violating code style,
> e.g. through git commit command line option `-n/--no-verify`.
